# EC327-GroupProject

## Description and Credits
 - This project is a desktop application for a slot machine game. It was created as a group project for the Software Engineering course, EC327, at Boston University.
 - My role was Technical Lead. I was responsible for the following:
   - Chose and researched the Godot gaming engine and made other essential game design choices.
   - Created and animdated most of the 3D assets in Blender (including the machine itself) and converting them to animated sprites.
   - All of the programming of the slot machine itself (pulling the lever, the spinning of the wheels, movement/inserting of coins, win logic, dynamic difficulty settings, etc.
   - Testing and debugging.
   - Managing Github and approving pull requests.
 - Additional credit goes to Ryan Darrow (Project Lead), Jayden Raphino (Interface Lead), Yanbo (Mark) Zhu (Specification Lead), and Matthew Rhee (Documentation Lead) for creation of intro/credit screens, sounds, additional blender assets and textures, project/team managament, and documentation.


## Other Notes
 - ProjectDocumentation.docx has both front-end and back-end functionality descriptions of the major components of the game. For more detailed comments: each script file, which can be found in the /src/Scripts folder, can be opened in text editors despite having a .gd file type
 - If you would like to try and download the executable and play it, the file can be found in the /misc/executables with the name EncoreLite.exe
 - You can view screen captures of the game in the docs folder.
